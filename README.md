# Turn-Sim
A soaring simulation of a glider attemping to locate and climb in thermals.

Test various soaring methods to find and keep the glider
circling within the rising thermal boundary. Also, waypoint
flight path planning and altitude management strategy.

Thermals are dynamic. In that, they are fixed-size (diameter
and column height) but are constantly rising and moving location
(based on local wind condition).

The project is in active development. It may not compile and may not run.

Compile using linux gcc with C++11. Developed using Code::Blocks IDE
